# Psychographic Profiling & Job Recommendation System

This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive Psychographic Profiling Model and a Job Recommendation System using Python. It involves analyzing demographic, geographic, and psychographic survey data to classify user personas, identify behavioral patterns, and match users with suitable job roles.

## üîç Project Overview

- Developed a full-scale Psychographic Profiling Marketing Model using Python to analyze survey data covering demographic, geographic, and psychographic dimensions.
- Built custom algorithms to extract behavioral patterns and personality traits from large datasets, including one with over **20,000+ entries** and another with **87+ survey variables**.
- Applied psychometric frameworks including **OCEAN (Big Five)**, **DISC**, and **BFI-2** to classify user profiles and improve segmentation strategies.
- Designed and implemented a look-alike modeling algorithm using **chi-squared testing** and **hypothesis testing** to identify high-potential audience clusters.
- Created a Job Recommendation System based on psychographic traits to match users with ideal job roles, enhancing both recruitment accuracy and candidate experience.
- Leveraged **Google Colab** for model development, experimentation, and visualization.
